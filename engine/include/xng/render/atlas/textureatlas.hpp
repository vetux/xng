     * A texture atlas abstraction for render graph.

     * The texture atlas contains an array texture for each TextureAtlasResolution.
     *
     * When a texture is added, it is added to the array texture with the closest matching or larger size.
     *
     * The texture is arranged to the bottom left so uv coordinates can simply be scaled with the ratio of the size
     * of the texture compared to the size of the array buffer.
     *
     * There are 12 array textures in total, which leaves 4 more texture buffer bindings free to use for other things.
