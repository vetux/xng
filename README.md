# xEngine

xEngine is a Game Engine library for C++. 

The engine is designed as a standalone modular toolkit from which different modules can be used independently.

This project is currently under heavy construction and should not be used in projects yet because the interface is still unstable and may change any time.

Once the project has reached a stable state there will be semantically versioned releases.

workflow

## Features
- Rendering
  - Render Graph Abstraction (WIP)

  - 2D Rendering with a simple SDL like interface
  - Sprite Animation
  - Skeletal Animation
  - Text Rendering
- Resource system
  - Uri Resource addressing
  - Multithreaded Resource streaming
  - Automatic Resource Lifetime handling
- Entity Component System interface using a data oriented architecture
- PAK file format with compression, chunking and encryption support
- Canvas layout engine (Will be replaced with Flexbox layouts)

## Adapters

Adapters are implementations of interfaces in the xEngine API (For example through 3rd party libraries) that can be optionally compiled into the engine library. If an adapter type is instantiated in an application, the corresponding adapter must be defined by the linked engine library by enabling the corresponding cmake option/s in [adapters.cmake](cmake/adapters.cmake) when compiling the engine library.

## Building
### Supported Platforms
- Linux
    - Tested Compiler: GCC 12.2.0 64bit
- Windows
    - Tested Compilers:
      - MSVC 2022 64bit
          - Build warnings are emitted due to the fact that xng uses STL types in dllexport types.
          - Users must ensure that their application is built with the same compiler version as the linked library because
            windows uses multiple STL dll files and allows loading of multiple STL version dlls into the same process. If
            the user links to a different STL version than the one used for building the engine dll there can be problems
            when passing types through the dll interface.
      - MinGW-w64 11
- Android
    - Tested Compiler: Android NDK r25c

Check [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for detailed building instructions.

## Notes
### Assimp Importer and Blender FBX Export
When exporting rigged meshes from blender to be imported with the assimp importer platform make sure to:
- Set the "Apply Scalings" to fbx unit scale.
- Rotate the mesh and the rig -90 degrees in the X axis and apply the rotation.
- Set the forward and up axis in the fbx exporter settings to Y forward and Z up to match blenders coordinate system.
- Uncheck "Key All Bones" and "Force Start/End Keyframes"
  - "Key All Bones" appears to do nothing at all
  - "Force Start/End Keyframes" creates invalid keyframes inside an animation for bones which are not keyframed in the animation.
- Run "Limit Total" in weight paint mode to ensure that there is no more than 4 bones per vertex.

### PBR Shading
Because I do not have or know anyone with a math degree I am dependent on tutorials for the lighting calculations.

I would welcome any math geniuses to help me out once the engine has reached a more stable state.
